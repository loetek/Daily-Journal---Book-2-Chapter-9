Daily Journal
The Daily Journal application will be your opportunity to take the concepts you learn in class, and practice with the exercises and apply them elaboratively throughout the course.

Daily Journal Design and Layout
Your first step is to build a form component in HTML through which you will enter your daily journal entries. It should contain the following fields.

Date field. Input elements in HTML can be of type date which will automatically render a calendar control for you to use.
Concepts covered. A short input field of type text where you enter in what concept(s) were covered and are driving the journal entry.
Journal entry. This is a textarea field where you can enter in as much text about what you learned, how you felt, and plans for the upcoming days.
Mood. This should be a select element with as many option child elements as you would like to describe your mood for the day. You can start with the simply happy, fine, and sad values, or pick your own scaling system.
After you have completed the form, place a button element beneath it labeled Record Journal Entry, or any other text that you would like.
